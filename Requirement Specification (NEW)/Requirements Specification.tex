	\section{Introduction}
	
		\vspace{0.2in}
	
		This document is the software requirements specification for a computerised marking system to be used by the University of Pretoria. It begins by addressing the purpose and vision of the project then continues with a general discussion on the background of the project. Thereafter, the architectural requirements are identified with a main focus on the access channel requirements, quality requirements, integration requirements, and architectural constraints. The function requirements follow by discussing the application functionality required by the users of the system.  In this section of the document, many diagrams are used to depict the flow of communication and interaction between the users and the system. It will also illustrate the processes that the system will need to complete and the states that the system will under go.  The next topic will communicate the open issues on some of the requirements, and the document concludes with a glossary of possibly unfamiliar terms used in this document.
		
	\section{Vision}
	
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		The purpose of this document is to communicate the requirements and proposed solution to the client, Mr Jan Kroeze, who requires a computer system for marking purposes. This document will outline the scope of the project and thus serve as a formal agreement and contract between the developers and the client. It will also serve as a reference and eliminate any confusion that may occur in the later stages of development.
	
	\section{Background}

		\vspace{0.2in}
		The University of Pretoria currently has a manual paper based marking system which has many flaws such as: losing marks is one of the major issues. Our solution aims to assist them by providing a computerised system. The required computer system should aid the marker and lecturers at the university in recording marks of assessments for students, and the maintenance of marks thereafter. It should also allow students to keep track with their marks.
		
		\vspace{0.1in}
		
		\begin{flushleft}
			The solution will consist of an application that students, markers and lecturers will use in the following way:
		\end{flushleft}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Markers will receive mark list of students and will be allowed to assign practical marks to the students via the mobile application. Lecturers will also be granted these permissions.
			\item Students will be able to view a list of their marks via the application
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{0.1in}
		
		\begin{flushleft}
			The solution will also consist of a web interface that will allow the following:
		\end{flushleft}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Lecturers can maintain and integrate marks
			\item Lecturers can request reports with a certain criteria. A graph of some nature or statistics will then be presented 
			\item An audit log will be updated automatically 
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{0.1in}
		
		\begin{flushleft}
			The solution has the following restrictions:
		\end{flushleft}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Users must be registered - A username and password is required for access to the system
			\item Marking lists may only be locked/unlocked by lecturers that are assigned to the course. Markers will be allowed to update marks according to the status of the mark list. Students may only view their mark when the mark list is locked.
			\item No one may be allowed to edit the audit log. Only lecturers have permission to view the audit log. 
		\end{itemize}

		\vspace{0.2in}

	\section{Architecture requirements}
	
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		\subsection{Access channel requirements}
		
			\vspace{0.2in}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Marker will gain access the mobile android application as well as the web interface can be used.
				\item Lectures have to use the web interface to administrate their modules and view audit logs.
				\item Student view all allocated marks through the mobile application as well as the web interface.
				\item Administrators use the web interface to view audits and control all lectures and modules.
			\end{itemize}
			

		\subsection{Quality requirements}
		
			\vspace{0.2in}
			
			\begin{itemize}
			
				\item Authentication
					\begin{itemize}
						\item All users have to login before they are able to access the system using a user name to identify, a password to authenticate where upon the authorized permissions will be granted.
					\end{itemize}
				
				\item Audit-ability
					\begin{itemize}
						\item All the actions of all the users will be added to the audit log.
						\item The events consider as audit trails will include:
						
						\begin{itemize}
							\item The login and logout of users.
							\item The assignment of marks.
							\item The modifications of any data.
						\end{itemize}	
					\end{itemize}

				\item Scalability
					\begin{itemize}
						\item The system should be able to handle multiple running practicals simultaneously
						\item The performance of the system should not be dependent on the number of concurrent users
					\end{itemize}
				
				\item Availability
				
					\begin{flushleft}
						The system should be available 99\% of the time if the under the pre-condition that the correct authentication information has been provided.
					\end{flushleft}
					
			\end{itemize}

				\item External API for data transfer between interconnecting systems. This API uses SOAP
				transfer the data.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\vspace{0.05in} 
		
		All API's should represent their data from SOAP to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item XML for interfacing with web servers using WSDL.
			\item Output marks to .CSV format.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{0.15in}

	\vspace{0.05in}
			
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performance:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	People viewing the marks should not need to wait extensively, //
		 			however the system can only be as fast as the connection to it.//
		 			There for the system cannot be expected to be faster than the connection\\
		 			that is being used.
			\item Documentation drawn up from the marks may take between  \\
					10 - 30 seconds to be compiled.
			\item Markers should be able to update marks within 10 seconds of each other.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Scalability:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The system will be designed with design patterns. These are used so that\\
			the it is easy to upgrade the different aspects independently. \\   
		\end{itemize}

		\item Reliability:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A software issue should not arise, but if it does the application \\
			must handle the problem and send an appropriate error message to the user. \\
			If data has failed to send the application must reattempt to upload the data \\
			for a specified amount of time (1 minute) or until such a time that the user \\
			aborts data transfer.		
		\end{itemize}
			
			
		\item Security:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item No user, who is unauthorized, may gain access to the system.
				\item Authorized users can only access the aspects of the system as \\
				allocated to them by the administrator.
				\item Security questions, as well as email addresses will be linked to each\\
					of the users. This will be used for password recovery.
				\end{itemize}
				
				
		\item Auditability:
				\begin{itemize}
				\item Each time marks are changed it will be recorded in an audit trail which not\\
				even the system administrator would be able to edit.
				\end{itemize}

	\section{Functional requirements}
	
		\vspace{0.2in}
		
		\subsection{Introduction}
			\begin{flushleft}
				\vspace{0.2in}
	
				The goal of the system is to provide the client with a secure, scalable and remotely accessible marking and mark management system. The system is comprised of four different facets which are listed below. It is intended to replace the current marking and mark management system employed by the client, which is currently paper and spreadsheet based.
				
				\vspace{0.5cm}
				\textbf{Student mark retrieval facet:}
				\vspace{0.1in}
				\\
				The goal of this facet is to provide the "Students" with a secure and private means to a read-only view of their marks, for the markable items of a specified course on the system. The means by which they will view the markable items will be in the form of a web interface and android application.
				
				\vspace{0.5cm}
				\textbf{Marker marking tool facet:}
				\vspace{0.1in}
				\\
				The goal of this facet is to provide "Markers", assigned to a particular course, with a mobile application to allow then to be able to add and update the mark of a specified student on the mark list for a particular markable item of the particular course. The application will allow "Markers" access to the mark list from any location where an internet connection is available. The application will be in the forms of a website interface and android application.
				
				\vspace{0.5cm}
				\textbf{Lecturer mark management facet:}
				\vspace{0.1in}
				\\
				The goal of this facet is to provide "Lectures", assigned to a particular course, with a means to manage the marks of each student registered to the course and mark structure of the course. Where the term manage comprises of adding, modifying and removing markable items, mark lists and the individual marks of students. Further the facet also has the goal of providing a means to report on mark related data on different levels of granularity of a particular course.
				
				\vspace{0.5cm}
				\textbf{Audit trail facet:}
				\vspace{0.1in}
				\\
				The goal of this facet is to give the system the ability to track all critical actions that occur on the system independent of any user interference and also provide a read-only view of such trails for authorised users of the system. Where critical actions comprise of adding, updating and removing any data on the database as well as login and logout actions.
